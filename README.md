# Introduction:

A book recommendation engine is a class of machine learning which offers book suggestions to the customer. Before the recommendation system, the major tendency to buy was to take a suggestion from friends. The engine recommends the books which are currently trending or highly rated or related to your interest. The books recommendation system is used by online websites which provide eBooks like google play books, open library, good Read’s, etc.

# Objective:

The main objective is to create a machine learning model to recommend relevant books to users based on popularity and user interests.

# Project Scope:

1) Recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy, or anything else depending on industries).
2) Recommendation systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. The main objective is to create a book recommendation system for users.
3) Since, here we are trying to recommend books to users based on their past purchases or ratings the user gave previously, we are basically trying different models like Popularity based recommender system, Collaborative filtering based recommender system (user-item or item-item) etc. We will be using the Popularity based recommender system to deal with the cold start problem, where we do not have history of past purchases of a particular user or where the user is totally new.

# Methodology:

Collaborative-based Filtering: Collaborative based filtering recommender systems are based on past interactions of users and target items.  In simple words here, we try to search for the look-alike customers and offer products based on what his or her lookalike has chosen. Let us understand with an example. X and Y are two similar users and X user has read A, B, and C books. And Y user has learned B, C, and D book then we will recommend A book to Y user and D book to X user.

K-Nearest Neighbor: KNN is a machine learning algorithm to find clusters of similar users based on common book ratings, and make predictions using the average rating of top-k nearest neighbors.

# Conclusion:

A Recommendation System is an act of trying to regulate the future work of the E-commerce industry. The prediction of user’s interest of books or any other item could yield remarkable profit and change in the field of decision-making, retail business, hotel business, tourism, digital content, movie databases. From this literature survey, we found that, the most suitable algorithm for predict books for users by considering their preference and by avoiding cold start problem is, the item based collaborative filtering with opinion mining on reviews. This algorithms will be a great benefit for users as well as the owner.
